### Sample Project for Everdays.

Set up a github repository for the project, call it izitest

Initialize a React application using Redux

Use our endpoint which will return 10 memorials, and display the name and creation date of each memorial, sorted in order of creationDate.

Endpoint: https://dev.requiemapp.com/public/memorial/random

Create a button on the page that when pressed will switch the sorting on the list to last name of the decedent (name.last)

Create a github repo and send us a link

Provide documentation in the readme file
